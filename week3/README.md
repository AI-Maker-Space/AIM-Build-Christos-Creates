# 🚀 Week 3: Chainlit w/ Langchain for Data Extraction

Welcome to Week 3 of **Christos Creates**, a part of the AI Makerspace Community's initiative. This week, we're diving into the integration of Chainlit with Langchain for enhancing Chat GPT-like applications.

## 📚 About This Week's Project

In this project, we focus on:

- **Chainlit Integration for Chat GPT-like Applications:** Understanding how Chainlit can be integrated into existing LLM-based applications to enhance their capabilities.
- **🌐 Chainlit + LangChain:** Exploring the synergy between Chainlit and LangChain and how they work together.
- **🛠️ Async vs Sync Implementations:** Delving into the differences and benefits of asynchronous and synchronous implementations in your applications.
- **🧍 Creating Custom Frontend or Using Chainlit's Default:** Learning how to customize the user interface to suit specific needs or using the default setup provided by Chainlit.
- **🐦🔗 Langchain LCEL:** Getting hands-on with Langchain's LCEL (Language Chain Embedded Links) feature.

### 🤖 Advanced Functionality:

- **Learn how to integrate Chainlit for Data Extraction:** A detailed guide to implementing data extraction features using Chainlit in your applications.

## 🔗 Resources and Links

To enhance your learning experience and provide additional support, here are some valuable resources:
