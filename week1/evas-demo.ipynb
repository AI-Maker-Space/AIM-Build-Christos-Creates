       "- Salt and pepper, to taste\n",
       "- 1 tbsp olive oil or vegetable oil\n",
       "- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n",
       "- 1/3 cup honey\n",
       "- 1/4 cup soy sauce (low sodium preferred)\n",
       "- 1/4 cup chicken broth or water\n",
       "- 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar or rice vinegar\n",
       "- 1 tsp cornstarch (optional, for thickening the sauce)\n",
       "- Sesame seeds and green onions, for garnish\n",

       "6. Return the chicken to the pan and toss to coat the chicken with the sauce. Continue to cook for a couple of minutes to ensure the chicken is fully cooked through and the sauce has permeated the meat.\n",

       "Enjoy your honey garlic chicken with a side of steamed rice, vegetables, or even over a bed of noodles. The sweetness of the honey paired with the garlic and soy sauce creates a delightful glaze that's sure to please those looking for a tasty chicken meal!"

       "- 2 tablespoons olive oil, extra-virgin, because we settle for nought but the finest\n",
       "- 4 cloves of garlic, minced with the precision of a maestro\n",
       "- 3/4 cup honey, liquid gold to caress the senses\n",
       "- 2 tablespoons soy sauce, for an umami embrace\n",
       "- 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, the dark illustrious essence of Modena\n",
       "- Fresh thyme, a handful, because what is life without fresh herbs?\n",

       "2. Season the chicken breasts generously with salt and black pepper, for these are the foundational pillars upon which flavor is built.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. In a pan of the most splendid quality, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is shimmering like a Mediterranean sea, add the chicken and cook until it's golden brown—about 3 minutes each side. We seek a crust that sings a song of caramelization.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. In the meantime, in a bowl fit for ambrosia, whisk together the honey, soy sauce, and balsamic vinegar until they perform a harmony of sweetness with a hint of tang.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Once the chicken has achieved a glory of golden hues, reduce the heat. Add the minced garlic around the chicken, stirring for but a moment to release its aromatic character without allowing it to burn.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Now, the honey concoction is poured over the chicken, enveloping it in a luscious glaze. Scatter the thyme upon this golden bath, allowing its essence to infuse.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven. Bake until the chicken surrenders its juices in clear adoration and the internal temperature reads 165 degrees Fahrenheit—a matter of approximately 15-20 minutes, give or take, as the oven's whim dictates.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. Behold, as the dish emerges, a glistening spectacle. Allow it to rest, for even beauty needs its respite.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. Garnish with a sprinkling of sesame seeds and perhaps a scatter of fresh parsley or chives to adorn it with the freshness of a meadow in spring.\n",
       "\n",
       "To serve, place a breast upon the plate with an artist's care, drizzle with the thickened honey glaze from the pan, and accompany with sides befitting its grandeur—perhaps a melody of roasted vegetables and a timbale of wild rice.\n",
