# Week 2: Mastering OpenAI Function Calling and Data Extraction

Welcome to Week 2 of **Christos Creates**! This week, we delve into the powerful features of OpenAI's function calling and data extraction, with a focus on producing structured and constrained data outputs. Let's jump right in!

## What You Will Learn

This session is packed with practical knowledge and hands-on experience:

- **OpenAI Function Calling**: Learn how to effectively use OpenAI's function calling feature to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs).
- **Constraining Data Output with Pydantic**: Discover how to use Pydantic, a powerful data validation and settings management tool, to ensure your data output meets specific format and type requirements.
- **Simplifying with Langchain**: Understand how Langchain, a framework for building applications with LLMs, can make these processes more intuitive and efficient.
- **Importance of Data Extraction and Function Calling**: Explore why mastering these skills is crucial in solving a wide range of problems in the realm of AI and development.
